              "\"Mexico, officially the United Mexican States, is a country in the southern\\nportion of North America.  It is bordered to the north by the United States; to\\nthe south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize,\\nand the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Mexico covers\\n1,972,550 square kilometers (761,610 sq mi), making it the world's 13th-largest\\ncountry by area; with approximately 126,014,024 inhabitants, it is the\\n10th-most-populous country and has the most Spanish-speakers. Mexico is\\norganized as a federal republic comprising 31 states and Mexico City, its\\ncapital. Other major urban areas include Monterrey, Guadalajara, Puebla,\\nToluca, Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and León.\\xa0Pre-Columbian Mexico traces its\\norigins to 8,000 BCE and is identified as one of the world's six cradles of\\ncivilization. In particular, the Mesoamerican region was home to many\\nintertwined civilizations; including the Olmec, Maya, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, and\\nPurepecha. Last were the Aztecs, who dominated the region in the century before\\nEuropean contact. In 1521, the Spanish Empire and its indigenous allies\\nconquered the Aztec Empire from its capital Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City),\\nestablishing the colony of New Spain. Over the next three centuries, Spain and\\nthe Catholic Church played an important role expanding the territory, enforcing\\nChristianity and spreading the Spanish language throughout. With the discovery\\nof rich deposits of silver in Zacatecas and Guanajuato, New Spain soon became\\none of the most important mining centers worldwide. Wealth coming from Asia and\\nthe New World contributed to Spain's status as a major world power for the next\\ncenturies, and brought about a price revolution in Western Europe. The colonial\\norder came to an end in the early nineteenth century with the War of\\nIndependence against Spain.\\xa0Mexico's early history as an independent nation\\nstate was marked by political and socioeconomic upheaval, both domestically and\\nin foreign affairs. The Federal Republic of Central America shortly seceded the\\ncountry. Then two invasions by foreign powers took place: first, by the United\\nStates as a consequence of the Texas Revolt by American settlers, which led to\\nthe Mexican–American War and huge territorial losses in 1848. After the\\nintroduction of liberal reforms in the Constitution of 1857, conservatives\\nreacted with the war of Reform and prompted France to invade the country and\\ninstall an Empire, against the Republican resistance led by liberal President\\nBenito Juárez, which emerged victorious. The last decades of the 19th century\\nwere dominated by the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz, who sought to modernize\\nMexico and restore order. However, the Porfiriato era led to great social\\nunrest and ended with the outbreak in 1910 of the decade-long Mexican\\nRevolution (civil war).  This conflict had profound changes in Mexican society,\\nincluding the proclamation of the 1917 Constitution, which remains in effect to\\nthis day. The remaining war generals ruled as a succession of presidents until\\nthe Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) emerged in 1929. The PRI in turn\\ngoverned Mexico for the next 70 years, first under a set of paternalistic\\ndevelopmental policies of considerable economic success. During World War II\\nMexico also played an important role for the U.S. war effort. Nonetheless, the\\nPRI regime resorted to repression and electoral fraud to maintain power; and\\nmoved the country to a more US-aligned neoliberal economic policy during the\\nlate 20th century. This culminated with the signing of the North American Free\\nTrade Agreement in 1994, which caused a major indigenous rebellion in the state\\nof Chiapas. PRI lost the presidency for the first time in 2000, against the\\nconservative party (PAN).\\xa0Mexico is a developing country, ranking 74th on the\\nHuman Development Index, but has the world's 15th-largest economy by nominal\\nGDP and the 11th-largest by PPP, with the United States being its largest\\neconomic partner. Its large economy and population, cultural influence, and\\nsteady democratization make Mexico a regional and middle power; it is often\\nidentified as an emerging power but is considered a newly industrialized state\\nby several analysts. Mexico ranks first in the Americas and seventh in the\\nworld for the number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It is also one of the\\nworld's 17 megadiverse countries, ranking fifth in natural biodiversity.\\nMexico's rich cultural and biological heritage, as well as varied climate and\\ngeography, makes it a major tourist destination: as of 2018, it was the sixth\\nmost-visited country in the world, with 39 million international arrivals.\\nHowever, the country continues to struggle with social inequality, poverty and\\nextensive crime. It ranks poorly on the Global Peace Index, due in large part\\nto ongoing conflict between drug trafficking syndicates, which violently\\ncompete for the US drug market and trade routes.  This drug war has led to over\\n120,000 deaths since 2006. Mexico is a member of United Nations, the G20, the\\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade\\nOrganization (WTO), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the\\nOrganization of American States, Community of Latin American and Caribbean\\nStates, and the Organization of Ibero-American States.Mexico, officially the\\nUnited Mexican States, is a country in the southern portion of North America.\\nIt is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the\\nPacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea;\\nand to the east by the Gulf of Mexico.
